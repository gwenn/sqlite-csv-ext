- Fix a bug/typo when lines exceed 100 characters.
- With the USE_HEADER_ROW option, wrap column names with double quotes because
  there is no way to make sure they are valid identifier.
- Add support to embedded new lines and escaped double-quotes.

TODO:
- Add an option (like USE_HEADER_ROW) to enable/disable double-quotes
  escaping.
